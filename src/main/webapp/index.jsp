            <h1>Chintha Dinesh Babu</h1>
            <p>My name is Chintha Dinesh Babu , and I am a passionate and motivated fresher in the field of
                full-stack java Development. I have recently completed my studies in Siddhartha institute of
                science and technology in the filed of Computer science and Engineering.
            </p>
            <p>I have hands on experience in building web applications using technologies like core java, J2EE,Spring
                Boot, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.
            </p>
            <p>One of my keep projects is an Event Management System where I developed a platform to allow users to view
                and book events. The Main aim of the event management system is to provide a platform for the users to
                view information about the events that took place in the past and future events. The application enables
                the user to view and book an ongoing or upcoming events in particular locality. Users should register
                themselves to log into the account for online booking of tickets. The users can be administrators,
                events organizers, and customers. They can first log into the website and see through the information
                such as details about the events.
            </p>
            <h4>I am eager to contribute to innovative development teams, learn from experienced professionals, and apply my technical knowledge to build impactful solutions.
